            This description omits all, or critical parts of the information requested by maintainers to be able to
            reproduce the issue:


             - the **complete** log history of your Elastic components, including `setup`.
             - any change(s) performed to the docker-elk configuration.
             - details about the runtime environment, for both Docker and Compose.


            Therefore, this issue will now be **closed**. Please open a new issue and fill in the template. It saves
            everyone's efforts, and allows maintainers to provide you with a solution in as few round trips as possible.

            Thank you for your understanding. :pray:

      # Due to eventual consistency, listing closed issues immediately after a
