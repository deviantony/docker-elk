            To avoid frequent and unnecessary back and forth in issue comments to ask for information that could have
            been provided right away in the issue description, maintainers created a clear issue template with all the
            information they need to be able to reproduce common issues, and ask everyone to follow it.


            **It appears that this issue description omits all, or critical parts the requested information.**


            Maintainers of this project wish they had the superpower to read minds. Alas, they are mere mortals who
            cannot understand the context in which this problem occurred without information such as:


             - your docker-elk configuration
             - details about your runtime environment
             - the complete log history of your Elastic components


            Therefore, this issue will now be **closed**. Thank you for your understanding. :pray:


            ---


            Next time, please be respectful of maintainers' time by providing the requested information right away. It
            saves everyone's efforts, and allows them to provide you with a solution with as few round trips as
            possible.

      # Due to eventual consistency, listing closed issues immediately after a
      # close does not always yield the expected results. A sleep is a simple
      # enough remediation to this issue.
