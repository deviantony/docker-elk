# This configuration was intended for version 7.9.2
#
# You should review these settings, and then update the main kibana.yml configuration file.
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#  You also need to update the URLs in your "elasticsearch.hosts" setting to use the "https" URL.
#  e.g. If your kibana.yml file currently has
#
#  elasticsearch.hosts: [ "http://localhost:9200" ]
#
#  then you should change this to:
#
#  elasticsearch.hosts: [ "https://localhost:9200" ]
#
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This configures Kibana to trust a specific Certificate Authority for connections to Elasticsearch
elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities: [ "config/elasticsearch-ca.pem" ]
