# TLS certificates

This directory contains pre-generated X.509 certificates and private keys which are used to secure the communications
between Elastic components using TLS. Those are valid until October 14 2030.

To re-generate those certificates and keys, follow the instructions below.

> [!WARNING]
> All commands assume you are inside the `tls` directory of the repository.

1. [Certificate Authority](#certificate-authority)
1. [Elasticsearch node certificate](#elasticsearch-node-certificate)
1. [Elasticsearch HTTP certificate and CA PEM certificate](#elasticsearch-http-certificate-and-ca-pem-certificate)
1. [Verification](#verification)
1. [Kibana server certificate _(optional)_](#kibana-server-certificate-optional)
1. [Fleet server certificate _(extension)_](#fleet-server-certificate-extension)

## Certificate Authority

Generate the Certificate Authority (CA) — in PKCS #12 format (`.p12`) — for signing Elasticsearch certificates, using
the `elasticsearch-certutil` tool that ships with Elasticsearch:

```none
$ docker run -it \
  -v ${PWD}:/usr/share/elasticsearch/tls \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.5.1 \
  bin/elasticsearch-certutil ca \
    --days 3650 \
    --out tls/ca/ca.p12
```

You will be prompted to enter an optional password to protect the CA key.

> [!NOTE]
> The pre-generated keys in this repository don't have any password set.

> [!WARNING]
> `<none>` indicates that the value can be left empty.

```none
Directory /usr/share/elasticsearch/tls/ca does not exist. Do you want to create it? [Y/n] y
Enter password for ca.p12 : <none>
```

At this stage, the structure of the `tls` directory should be:

```tree
tls
├── ca
│   └── ca.p12
└── instances.yml
```

## Elasticsearch node certificate

Generate a certificate and key — in PKCS #12 format (`.p12`) — that Elasticsearch nodes will use to **communicate with
each other** (transport networking layer), using the `elasticsearch-certutil` tool that ships with Elasticsearch:

```none
$ docker run -it \
  -v ${PWD}:/usr/share/elasticsearch/tls \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.5.1 \
  bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert \
    --days 3650 \
    --ca tls/ca/ca.p12 \
    --in tls/instances.yml \
    --out tls/certificate-bundle.zip
```

You will be prompted to enter the password of the Certificate Authority (CA) created in the [Certificate
Authority](#certificate-authority) section, as well as an optional password to protect the Elasticsearch key. Please be
aware that the password you enter here, if not empty, will have to be **added to the Elasticsearch keystore on every
node** using the [`elasticsearch-keystore`][es-keystore] CLI tool (see below).

> [!NOTE]
> The pre-generated keys in this repository don't have any password set.

> [!WARNING]
> `<none>` indicates that the value can be left empty.

```none
Enter password for CA (tls/ca/ca.p12) : <none>
Enter password for elasticsearch/elasticsearch.p12 : <none>
```

> [!NOTE]
> In case you entered a password above, execute the following 2 additional commands (Elasticsearch *must* be running):
>
> ```console
> $ docker compose exec -T elasticsearch bin/elasticsearch-keystore add xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.secure_password
> Enter value for xpack.security.transport.ssl.keystore.secure_password: <password>
> ```
>
> ```console
> $ docker compose exec -T elasticsearch bin/elasticsearch-keystore add xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.secure_password
> Enter value for xpack.security.transport.ssl.truststore.secure_password: <password>
> ```

Extract the generated certificate archive:

```console
$ sudo unzip certificate-bundle.zip
Archive:  certificate-bundle.zip
   creating: elasticsearch/
  inflating: elasticsearch/elasticsearch.p12
```

You can then safely remove the Zip file generated by the `elasticsearch-certutil` tool in the previous step:

```console
$ sudo rm certificate-bundle.zip
```

At this stage, the structure of the `tls` directory should be:

```tree
tls
├── ca
│   └── ca.p12
├── elasticsearch
│   └── elasticsearch.p12
└── instances.yml
```

## Elasticsearch HTTP certificate and CA PEM certificate

Generate a certificate and key — in PKCS #12 format (`.p12`) — that Elasticsearch nodes will use to **securely expose
their REST API** (HTTP layer), using the `elasticsearch-certutil` tool that ships with Elasticsearch.

The command also creates a PEM-formatted version of the Elasticsearch CA certificate, which other components (Logstash,
Kibana, extensions...) can use to verify Elasticsearch's certificate chain and host name while communicating with it
over HTTPS.

```none
$ docker run -it \
  -v ${PWD}:/usr/share/elasticsearch/tls \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.5.1 \
  bin/elasticsearch-certutil http
```

When prompted, supply the correct path to the CA certificate archive generated in the previous step. As a reference,
here are the values that were used to create the pre-generated certificates from this repository:

> [!WARNING]
> `<none>` indicates that the value is to be left empty.

```none
Generate a CSR? [y/N] n
Use an existing CA? [y/N] y
CA Path: /usr/share/elasticsearch/tls/ca/ca.p12
Password for ca.p12: <none>
For how long should your certificate be valid? [5y] 10y
Generate a certificate per node? [y/N] n
(Enter all the hostnames that you need, one per line.)
elasticsearch
localhost
Is this correct [Y/n] y
(Enter all the IP addresses that you need, one per line.)
<none>
Is this correct [Y/n] y
Do you wish to change any of these options? [y/N] n
Provide a password for the "http.p12" file: <none>
What filename should be used for the output zip file? tls/elasticsearch-ssl-http.zip
```

Extract the generated certificates:

```console
$ sudo unzip elasticsearch-ssl-http.zip
Archive:  elasticsearch-ssl-http.zip
  inflating: elasticsearch/README.txt
  inflating: elasticsearch/http.p12
  inflating: elasticsearch/sample-elasticsearch.yml
   creating: kibana/
  inflating: kibana/README.txt
  inflating: kibana/elasticsearch-ca.pem
  inflating: kibana/sample-kibana.yml
```

You can then safely remove the Zip file generated by the `elasticsearch-certutil` command in the previous step:

```console
$ sudo rm elasticsearch-ssl-http.zip
```

At this stage, the structure of the `tls` directory should be:

```tree
tls
├── ca
│   └── ca.p12
├── elasticsearch
│   ├── README.txt
│   ├── elasticsearch.p12
│   ├── http.p12
│   └── sample-elasticsearch.yml
├── instances.yml
└── kibana
    ├── README.txt
    ├── elasticsearch-ca.pem
    └── sample-kibana.yml
```

## Verification

(Re)start the stack using `docker compose [up|restart]` to load the certificates generated in the steps described
earlier in this document.

To verify that stack components are successfully communicating with Elasticsearch over TLS, ensure the following
messages are logged to the console.

Logstash:

```log
[WARN ][logstash.outputs.elasticsearch][main] Restored connection to ES instance {:url=>"https://logstash_internal:xxxxxx@elasticsearch:9200/"}
```

Kibana:

```jsonc
{"type":"log",...,"tags":["status","plugin:elasticsearch","info"],...,"message":"Status changed from yellow to green - Ready","prevState":"yellow","prevMsg":"Waiting for Elasticsearch"}
```

## Kibana server certificate _(optional)_

Communications between web browsers and Kibana are **not secured** by default in docker-elk.

The reason for not enabling TLS by default in the Kibana web server is that web browsers reject certificates signed by
untrusted Certificate Authorities (CA), so the procedure of securing communications with Kibana require some extra steps
on the user's end, such as manually adding the Certificate Authority to the trust store of the web browser or operating
system.

If you are willing to accept certificates signed by this project's **untrusted** Certificate Authority, it is possible
to enable this feature nevertheless by simply switching the value of the `server.ssl.enabled` option to `true` inside
the [`kibana.yml` file](../kibana/config/kibana.yml). After this, Kibana must be accessed using the `https://` URL
scheme instead of plain `http://`.

> [!WARNING]
> It is preferable to request certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority such as [Let’s Encrypt][letsencrypt]
> rather than from a self-signed Certificate Authority.

To re-generate the certificate and key used by the Kibana server, use the `elasticsearch-certutil` tool already
mentioned in the previous sections. In the example command below, ensure the DNS name(s) of the certificate match the
public URL of Kibana:

```none
$ docker run -it \
  -v ${PWD}:/usr/share/elasticsearch/tls \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.5.1 \
  bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert \
    --days 3650 \
    --ca tls/ca/ca.p12 \
    --dns kibana.example.com,localhost \
    --pem \
    --out tls/kibana-server.zip
```

You will be prompted to enter the password of the Certificate Authority (CA) created in the [Certificate
Authority](#certificate-authority) section.

> [!NOTE]
> The pre-generated keys in this repository don't have any password set.

> [!WARNING]
> `<none>` indicates that the value can be left empty.

```none
Enter password for CA (tls/ca/ca.p12) : <none>
```

Extract the generated certificate and key:

```console
$ sudo unzip -j kibana-server.zip -d kibana
Archive:  kibana-server.zip
  inflating: kibana/instance.crt
  inflating: kibana/instance.key
```

You can then safely remove the Zip file generated by the `elasticsearch-certutil` command in the previous step:

```console
$ sudo rm kibana-server.zip
```

At this stage, the structure of the `tls` directory should be:

```tree
tls
├── ca
│   └── ca.p12
├── elasticsearch
│   ├── README.txt
│   ├── elasticsearch.p12
│   ├── http.p12
│   └── sample-elasticsearch.yml
├── instances.yml
└── kibana
    ├── README.txt
    ├── elasticsearch-ca.pem
    ├── instance.crt
    ├── instance.key
    └── sample-kibana.yml
```

## Fleet server certificate _(extension)_

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure also applies to integrations that support exposing a server over TLS, such as APM Server.

To re-generate the certificate and key used by the Fleet server, use the `elasticsearch-certutil` tool already mentioned
in the previous sections. In the example command below, ensure the DNS name(s) of the certificate match the URL used by
Elastic Agents to communicate with the Fleet server:

```none
$ docker run -it \
  -v ${PWD}:/usr/share/elasticsearch/tls \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.5.1 \
  bin/elasticsearch-certutil cert \
    --days 3650 \
    --ca tls/ca/ca.p12 \
    --dns fleet.example.com,fleet-server,localhost \
    --pem \
    --out tls/fleet-server.zip
```

You will be prompted to enter the password of the Certificate Authority (CA) created in the [Certificate
Authority](#certificate-authority) section.

> [!NOTE]
> The pre-generated keys in this repository don't have any password set.

> [!WARNING]
> `<none>` indicates that the value can be left empty.

```none
Enter password for CA (tls/ca/ca.p12) : <none>
```

Extract the generated certificate and key:

```console
$ sudo unzip -j fleet-server.zip -d fleet
Archive:  fleet-server.zip
  inflating: fleet/instance.crt
  inflating: fleet/instance.key
```

You can then safely remove the Zip file generated by the `elasticsearch-certutil` command in the previous step:

```console
$ sudo rm fleet-server.zip
```

At this stage, the structure of the `tls` directory should be:

```tree
tls
├── ca
│   └── ca.p12
├── elasticsearch
│   ├── README.txt
│   ├── elasticsearch.p12
│   ├── http.p12
│   └── sample-elasticsearch.yml
├── instances.yml
├── kibana
│   ├── README.txt
│   ├── elasticsearch-ca.pem
│   └── sample-kibana.yml
└── fleet
    ├── instance.crt
    └── instance.key
```
