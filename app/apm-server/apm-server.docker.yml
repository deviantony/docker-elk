#================================= Paths ==================================

# The home path for the apm-server installation. This is the default base path
# for all other path settings and for miscellaneous files that come with the
# distribution.
# If not set by a CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the
# home path is the location of the binary.
#path.home:

# The configuration path for the apm-server installation. This is the default
# base path for configuration files, including the main YAML configuration file
# and the Elasticsearch template file. If not set by a CLI flag or in the
# configuration file, the default for the configuration path is the home path.
#path.config: ${path.home}

# The data path for the apm-server installation. This is the default base path
# for all the files in which apm-server needs to store its data. If not set by a
# CLI flag or in the configuration file, the default for the data path is a data
# subdirectory inside the home path.
#path.data: ${path.home}/data

# The logs path for an apm-server installation. If not set by a CLI flag or in the
# configuration file, the default is a logs subdirectory inside the home path.
#path.logs: ${path.home}/logs

#================================= Logging =================================

# There are three options for the log output: syslog, file, and stderr.
# Windows systems default to file output. All other systems default to syslog.

# Sets the minimum log level. The default log level is info.
# Available log levels are: error, warning, info, or debug.
#logging.level: info

# Enable debug output for selected components. To enable all selectors use ["*"].
# Other available selectors are "beat", "publish", or "service".
# Multiple selectors can be chained.
#logging.selectors: [ ]

# Send all logging output to syslog. The default is false.
#logging.to_syslog: true

# If enabled, apm-server periodically logs its internal metrics that have changed
# in the last period. For each metric that changed, the delta from the value at
# the beginning of the period is logged. Also, the total values for
# all non-zero internal metrics are logged on shutdown. The default is false.
#logging.metrics.enabled: false

# The period after which to log the internal metrics. The default is 30s.
#logging.metrics.period: 30s

# Logging to rotating files. When true, writes all logging output to files.
# The log files are automatically rotated when the log file size limit is reached.
#logging.to_files: true
#logging.files:
  # Configure the path where the logs are written. The default is the logs directory
  # under the home path (the binary location).
  #path: /var/log/apm-server

  # The name of the files where the logs are written to.

  # Configure log file size limit. If limit is reached, log file will be
  # automatically rotated.

  # Number of rotated log files to keep. Oldest files will be deleted first.
  #keepfiles: 7

  # The permissions mask to apply when rotating log files. The default value is 0600.
  # Must be a valid Unix-style file permissions mask expressed in octal notation.
  #permissions: 0600

  # Enable log file rotation on time intervals in addition to size-based rotation.
  # Intervals must be at least 1s. Values of 1m, 1h, 24h, 7*24h, 30*24h, and 365*24h
  # are boundary-aligned with minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years as
  # reported by the local system clock. All other intervals are calculated from the
  # Unix epoch. Defaults to disabled.
  #interval: 0

#=============================== HTTP Endpoint ===============================

# apm-server can expose internal metrics through a HTTP endpoint. For security
# reasons the endpoint is disabled by default. This feature is currently experimental.
# Stats can be access through http://localhost:5066/stats. For pretty JSON output
# append ?pretty to the URL.

# Defines if the HTTP endpoint is enabled.
#http.enabled: false

# The HTTP endpoint will bind to this hostname or IP address. It is recommended to use only localhost.
#http.host: localhost

# Port on which the HTTP endpoint will bind. Default is 5066.
#http.port: 5066

#============================= X-pack Monitoring =============================

# APM server can export internal metrics to a central Elasticsearch monitoring
# cluster.  This requires x-pack monitoring to be enabled in Elasticsearch.  The
# reporting is disabled by default.

# Set to true to enable the monitoring reporter.
#monitoring.enabled: false

# Most settings from the Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that these settings should be configured to point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration. This means that if you have the Elasticsearch output configured,
# you can simply uncomment the following line.
#monitoring.elasticsearch:

  # Protocol - either `http` (default) or `https`.
  #protocol: "https"

  # Authentication credentials - either API key or username/password.
  #api_key: "id:api_key"

  # The number of seconds to wait before trying to reconnect to Elasticsearch
  # after a network error. After waiting backoff.init seconds, apm-server
  # tries to reconnect. If the attempt fails, the backoff timer is increased
  # exponentially up to backoff.max. After a successful connection, the backoff
  # timer is reset. The default is 1s.
  #backoff.init: 1s

  # The maximum number of seconds to wait before attempting to connect to
  # Elasticsearch after a network error. The default is 60s.
  #backoff.max: 60s

  # Configure HTTP request timeout before failing an request to Elasticsearch.
  #timeout: 90
