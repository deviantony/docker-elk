# Fleet Server

> [!WARNING]
> This extension currently exists for preview purposes and should be considered **EXPERIMENTAL**. Expect regular changes

Fleet provides central management capabilities for [Elastic Agents][fleet-doc] via an API and web UI served by Kibana,
with Elasticsearch acting as the communication layer.
Fleet Server is the central component which allows connecting Elastic Agents to the Fleet.

## Requirements

The Fleet Server exposes the TCP port `8220` for Agent to Server communications.

## Usage

To include Fleet Server in the stack, run Docker Compose from the root of the repository with an additional command line
argument referencing the `fleet-compose.yml` file:

```console
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f extensions/fleet/fleet-compose.yml up
```

## Configuring Fleet Server

Fleet Server — like any Elastic Agent — is configured via [Agent Policies][fleet-pol] which can be either managed
through the Fleet management UI in Kibana, or statically pre-configured inside the Kibana configuration file.

To ease the enrollment of Fleet Server in this extension, docker-elk comes with a pre-configured Agent Policy for Fleet
Server defined inside [`kibana/config/kibana.yml`][config-kbn].

Please refer to the following documentation page for more details about configuring Fleet Server through the Fleet
management UI: [Fleet UI Settings][fleet-cfg].

## Known Issues

- Logs are only collected within the Fleet Server's container. We would like to emulate the behaviour of the existing
  Filebeat extension, and collect logs from all ELK containers out-of-the-box. Unfortunately, this use-case is only
  supported starting with the version 8.x of the Elastic stack.
- The Elastic Agent auto-enrolls using the `elastic` super-user. With this approach, you do not need to generate a
  service token — either using the Fleet management UI or [CLI utility][es-svc-token] — prior to starting this
  extension. However convenient that is, this approach _does not follow security best practices_, and we recommend
  generating a service token for Fleet Server instead.
